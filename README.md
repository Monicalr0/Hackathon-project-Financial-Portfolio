## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
For the project, out team is aimed to deisgn an application that helps clients to manage a financial portfolio. Our main goal is to help client manage their stock and cash, and identify the market trend. 

- IDEAL: The tool should facilitate clients to browse portfolios, view the performance of the portfolios via graphs and numbers, add or remove tickers from their portfolios. 
- REALITY: 
- CONSEQUENCES: Providing this tool allows clients to have an easy to use interfaces that can help them understand the current trend in the market, view the status of their own financial portfolios and make cooresponding management. This can help the clients to have a clearer understanding and gain more control over their investment, hence encourage more active engagement into the market. 

<!-- It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options
for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or “to be” state of the process or product. At large, this section
  should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or “as is” state of the process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
  This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution. -->

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
<!-- TODO: updated to flow chart if needed? -->
Dependencies
  1. Building the MVP: we start by retriving and parsing data using Yahoo API, and building the simplest backend using Flask, MySQL to diplay the list of tickers and their daily change in price over 8 months period in 2023. 

Limitation

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

<!-- TODO: write this section after th project structure is mostly finished.  -->
### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```
<!-- TODO: write this section after th project structure is mostly finished.  -->
### Installing 

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```
